#   DO NOT JUST RUN THIS. EXAMINE AND JUDGE. RUN AT YOUR OWN RISK.
#
# Purpose:
#   On the FIRST login of the Kiro niri (DankMaterialShell) edition, set
#   DMS's wallpaper to the shipped Kiro wallpaper so the desktop is
#   Kiro-branded out of the box (DMS then derives its matugen palette from
#   it). Guards on a stamp file so it runs exactly once.
# Why:
#   This edition ships no DMS settings.json (DMS generates its own at
#   runtime, and a hand-seeded partial file risks breaking its schema), so
#   the wallpaper is set over IPC instead. `dms ipc call` only works once
#   the shell is up, so poll for it rather than racing a fixed sleep. Once
#   stamped this is a no-op, so it never fights a wallpaper the user later
#   picks in DMS.
